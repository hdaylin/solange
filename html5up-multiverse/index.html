							<h2>Interlude: Dad Was Mad</h2>
							<p>I was the first, one of the first. My first day, a state trooper caught me, put me in the backseat of the car, and meeting the other black kids, was six of us. And seeing all of those parents, and also KKK members having signs and throwing cans at us, spitting at us. We lived in the threat of death every day. Every day. So I was just lost in this vacuum between integration and segregation and, and racism. That was my childhood. I was angry for years... angry, very angry</p>

							<h2>Interlude: Tina Taught Me</h2>
							<p>
								"I think part of it is accepting that it's so much beauty in being Black. And that's the thing that I guess I get emotional about, because, I've always known that. I've always been proud to be Black. Never wanted to be nothing else. Loved everything about it, just...

It's such beauty in Black people, and it really saddens me when we're not allow to express that pride in being Black; and that if you do then it's considered anti-white. No! You just pro-Black. And that's okay. The two don't go together. Because you celebrate Black culture does not mean that you don't like white culture; or that you putting it down. It's just taking pride

What's irritating is when somebody says, you know, 'They're racist!' 'That's reverse racism!' or 'They have a Black History Month, but we don't have a White History Month!'
Well, all we've ever been taught is white history: so why are you mad at that? Why does that makes you angry? That is to suppress me and to make me not be proud."</p>

							<h2>Interlude: For Us By Us</h2>
							<p>
								[Master P:]
"And they offered me a million dollar deal, and had the check ready. Said I wouldn't be able to use my name. I was fighting my brother, because 'Man, you shoulda took the million dollars!' I said 'No, what you think I'm worth? If this white man offer me a million dollars I gotta be worth forty, or fifty... Or ten or something.'

To being able to make "Forbes" and come from the Projects. You know, "Top 40 Under 40." Which they said couldn't be done. Had twenty records on the top "Billboard" at one time. For an independent company. Black owned company. You know, going to the white lady's house where my Grandmother lived at, and say, 'Look, you don't have to work here no more Big Mama! We got more money than the people on St. Charles Street.'

And I, I took that anger and said 'I'mma put it into my music.' I tell people all the time, if you don't understand my record, you don't understand me, so this is not for you."
